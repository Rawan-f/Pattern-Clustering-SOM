# Pattern-Clustering-SOM
This project implements a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) using the MiniSom library in Python. The SOM is trained on GloVe word embeddings, and the code includes functionality to vary the number of neurons (clusters) and evaluate the clustering performance using precision, recall, and F1 score.
